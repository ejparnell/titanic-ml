    "\n",
    "**Error Analysis:**\n",
    "- **Confusion matrix and classification report** show strong recall for survivors, but some false negatives among women and children persist.\n",
    "- **Overfitting risk detected:** Training-CV gap (9.9%) exceeds recommended threshold (≤ 3%).\n",
    "- **CV stability:** Standard deviation (2.2%) slightly above target (≤ 2.0%), indicating some fold variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robustness Checks:**\n",
    "- **Feature importance:** Top predictors are Sex, Title, Age, FarePerPerson, confirming domain knowledge.\n",
    "- **High-leakage features:** TicketGroupSize and CabinKnown have moderate impact; removing them reduces accuracy by ~1-2%.\n",
    "- **Threshold sensitivity:** Model performance stable across reasonable probability thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalization:**\n",
    "- **Model generalizes well to hold-out folds, but may overfit on small dataset.**\n",
    "- **No data leakage detected:** All transformations applied consistently to train/test sets."

    "## 5. Risks, Limitations & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks & Limitations:**\n",
    "- **Overfitting risk:** Model complexity (800 estimators) may be excessive for 891 training samples.\n",
    "- **CV instability:** Fold variance (2.2%) suggests sensitivity to data splits.\n",
    "- **Small dataset:** Limits generalization and increases variance.\n",
    "- **Potential for data shift:** Real-world deployment may encounter different distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- **Reduce model complexity:** Consider fewer estimators or regularization.\n",
    "- **GroupKFold by Ticket:** To further mitigate optimistic bias from family/group leakage.\n",
    "- **Ensemble averaging:** Combine top models for improved stability.\n",
    "- **Error analysis:** Focus on misclassified women/children and high-leakage groups.\n",
    "- **Monitor LB vs CV gap:** If public leaderboard score is much lower than CV, revisit feature engineering and validation strategy."
