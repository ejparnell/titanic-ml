    "# Business Understanding: Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. After colliding with an iceberg, the \"unsinkable\" ship sank, resulting in the death of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew due to insufficient lifeboats.\n",
    "\n",
    "While survival had elements of luck, certain groups of people had higher survival rates than others. This Kaggle competition challenges us to build a predictive model to answer: **\"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?\"** using passenger data including name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and other factors.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Primary Goal\n",
    "**Predict passenger survival** on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Specifically:\n",
    "- Build a binary classification model to predict the `Survived` target variable (0 = did not survive, 1 = survived)\n",
    "- Use passenger characteristics from the training data to make predictions on the test set\n",
    "- Submit predictions in the required format: `PassengerId`, `Survived` columns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competition Context\n",
    "- **Platform**: Kaggle - \"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster\"\n",
    "- **Type**: Binary classification problem\n",
    "- **Target**: Predict survival (0 or 1) for passengers in the test set\n",
    "- **Historical significance**: Understanding survival patterns from one of history's most famous maritime disasters"

    "## Business Questions & Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions to Answer\n",
    "1. **Demographics**: What role did gender, age, and class play in survival?\n",
    "2. **Social Status**: Did passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) significantly impact survival rates?\n",
    "3. **Family Structure**: How did traveling with family members affect survival chances?\n",
    "4. **Economic Factors**: Did fare paid correlate with survival probability?\n",
    "5. **Location**: Did cabin location or port of embarkation matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Hypotheses\n",
    "Based on historical knowledge of the disaster:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong Predictors (Expected):**\n",
    "- **Gender**: Women had higher survival rates (\"women and children first\" protocol)\n",
    "- **Class**: First-class passengers had better access to lifeboats\n",
    "- **Age**: Children were prioritized for rescue\n",
    "\n",
    "**Moderate Predictors (Possible):**\n",
    "- **Family Size**: Small families might coordinate better than large groups\n",
    "- **Fare**: Higher fares might indicate better cabin locations\n",
    "- **Embarked**: Different ports might reflect different passenger demographics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weak Predictors (Uncertain):**\n",
    "- **Name/Title**: Might indicate social status beyond class\n",
    "- **Ticket**: Could reveal group bookings or special arrangements"

    "**3. Historical Bias** 🟡 **MEDIUM**\n",
    "- 1912 social structures different from modern context\n",
    "- Survival may reflect societal biases of the era\n",

    "- Training data is representative of the test data\n",
    "- Missing data patterns are consistent between train/test\n",
